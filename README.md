# Macro Executor

This module adds a button to the macro directory as well as context menu to execute a macro without needing to put it on your hotbar or open the macro edit application.

That's it.  That's the whole module.

## But why?

Because I have a lot of macros that I do not use often enough to warrant putting on my hot bar, and found opening the editor and clicking "Execute Macro" to be annoying.  And since many of those macros are visual effects of some sort, having the macro editor open can block the actual visuals.
